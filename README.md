# Repositories Explorer

A simple **GitHub user and repository explorer** built with **React** and **TypeScript**.  
Search GitHub users, view their profiles, and browse repositories. Designed **mobile-first** with good UX.

This project allows you to type a GitHub username, search for users, expand to see their repositories, and open any repository in a new tab. Loading states, errors, and empty states are handled gracefully. The app is fully responsive for mobile view.
